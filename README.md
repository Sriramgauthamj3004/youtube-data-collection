# youtube-data-collection
This Project is based on Youtube Data Harvesting.Collecting a youtube datas using channel ids and collect &store the datas of youtube channels.
In this project the users we can easily able to get the information about the youtube channels through channel id. We are analyse the data of the channel using MONGODB
and SQL and STREAMLIT are used in this project to make the user so friendly to collect the datas about the youtube channels and the user can retrive ,save and query the youtube channel and video datas.

TOOLS USED IN PROJECT :

JUPYTER :
This is a best platform to build the python program for developers to develop the python language. It is very user friendly to import the libraries and install , this platform is make easy way to run the python program with your incredible python skills.

PYTHON:
 Python is a more powerful language to develop the anything and everything.Python is very easy to learn and understand, it is a primary language to employed for developing for compelete application including data retrival and analysis and visualizaton also. This python language is easily understandable for machines and alos for humans.

 GOOGLEAPI CLIENT :
 The Google api client is key for communicating the data for the google application using the API.Every user have a individual api keys,it is a primary purpose in this project to interact with youtube data API V3,allowing to collect the youtube datas of information like channel details , video details and informations, playlist informations and comments details.
 By using api key the pyhton developer can easily to fetch a data of youtube and manipulate a youtube extensive data conver through a code.

 MONGODB:
 MongoDB is built on a scale out architecture that has popular with developers all kind of developing data into data schemas.As a database of document,Mongodb is easily for developers any type of data to be store in structure or unstructure data in json method. It uses a json like format to store the documents. Json is Javascript Object Notation it is used to transmitting data in web application.

 POSTGRESQL:
 Postgresql is a open source, advanced and highly scalable databasse management system(DBMS)know it realiablity and extensive features It provides a platform for storing a data of in table form and managing structured data , supporting a various data types and advanced SQL features.

 YOUTUBE DATA SCRAPPING:
 When engaging in the scrapping the youtube data content its so crucial to approach in more ethical and responsible way. Respecting the terms and youtube conditions ,obtaining appropraite the organization and ahering the data protection regulation are fundatamental considerations. The collected dat must be handled in responsibility to ensure the privacy and preventing any misuse or misrepresentation.Futhurmore it is more imporatnt to take into the account the potential impact on this platform and scrapping process. we can uphold the while extracting the data from the youtube data.

 REQURIED LIBARIES:
 1.Googleapiclient.discovery
 2.pymongo
 3.pandas
 4.streamlit
 5.psycopg2

 FEATURES:
YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING: This project is used for collecting the channel id from the youtube channel using the api key.Then gettting a channel id and making a code for extracting a data using the python language get the inforamtion of channel regarding channels information and video information using the youtube api.

Storage of data in MONGODB database as a data collections or data list.
Migartion of data from the data collections in mongodb and convert into tabular form to a SQL database for effiecient querying and analysis.
Search and retriveal of data from the sql data base using different search options
